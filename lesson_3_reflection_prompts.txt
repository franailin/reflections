When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository if lots of people working on a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there are many people working on the project and you automatically pull, there can be conflicts with different versions.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are for github, clones is for local and github, branches is for local only.

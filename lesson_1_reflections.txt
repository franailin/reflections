How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It helped me find the bug because I knew which lines were different and so I knew where to look.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Well, I guess having a history lets you see your past revisions which can then be compared to the current version. This way you know what you have 
	changed and you have the option of restoring to the previous version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	You have to save multiple files in one commit because those files might relate to each other so you need to see the different changes in all the files.
